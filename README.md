#### Weather and Vacation API Observable Trends


Tred 1: The strongest correlation appears to be a cities maximum temperature in relation to its proximity to the equator. With cities located closest to the equator experiencing a higher maximum temperature. This occurs because as locations closer to the equator receive greater amounts of direct sunlight and for longer amounts of time. 

Tred 2: Latitude does not appear to be a good predictor of wind speed or cloudiness as neither of these factors had a strong correlation linked to latitude. 

Trend 3: The Southern Hemisphere had a slightly lower maximum temperature compared to the northern hemisphere and also had a stronger correlational relationship between between max temp and latitude. Showing a stronger relationship than even the Norther Hemisphere between temperature increase and proximity to the equator. This occurs because the southern hemisphere has more ocean compared to land mass and the bodies of water tend to make the temperature more temperate.

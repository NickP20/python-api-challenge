#### Weather and Vacation API Observable Trends


Tred 1: The strongest correlation appears to be a cities maximum temperature in relation to its proximity to the equator. With cities located closest to the equator experiencing a higher maximum temperature. 

Tred 2: Latitude does not appear to be a good predictor of wind speed or cloudiness as neither of these factors had a strong correlation linked to latitude. 

Trend 3: The Southern Hemisphere had a slightly lower maximum temperature compared to the northern hemisphere and also had a stronger correlational relationship between between max temp and latitude. Showing a stronger relationship than even the Norther Hemisphere between temperature increase and proximity to the equator.
